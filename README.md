# Chunk-Loader-Datapack v.1.0.0

With Chunk Loader Datapack the Chunk Loader is added to the game. With it - surprise - you can load chunks.
Normally the chunks are not loaded anymore when you are out of sight of a player, but with Chunk Loader they are loaded no matter where you are in the world.
The Chunk Loader can be crafted in the Craftingtable as shown in the picture.

For this datapack there is texturepack that makes it look a lot better (https://www.dropbox.com/s/n645gh8udps54cl/Chunk%20Loader%20Texture%20Pack.zip?dl=1)

This datapack supports with my Language Pack (https://link-to.net/80983/2mal3sLanguagePack) the languages German, Spanish and French.


To uninstall, enter /function #cld:uninstall and drag the datapack folder from the datapacks folder of the World
