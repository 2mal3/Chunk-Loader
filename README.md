# Chunk-Loader-Datapack v.1.1.8
Compatibility: Multiplayer 1.14+

With Chunk Loader Datapack the Chunk Loader is added to the game. With it - surprise - you can load chunks.
Normally the chunks are not loaded anymore when you are out of sight of a player, but with Chunk Loader they are loaded no matter where you are in the world.    
How to crafted the chunk loader is shown on the Planet minecfraft website and in the datapack advancement.                     
If you want to disable the datapack messages, you can use the `/scoreboard players set $chlo.messages chlo.data 0` command.                                                                   
WARNING: If you load too many chunks with this datapack it can come to lags.                          

To make this datapack work you need the [resurcepack](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9qk4izhl6lqmtoa/Chunk-Loader-Resurcepack.zip?dl=1), so that the chunk loader is displayed correctly.
