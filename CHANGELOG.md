Because of the big changes in this update, old chunk loaders will not work. I recommend uninstalling the old datapack first and then reinstalling the new version from scratch.

### New

- update to Minecraft version 1.19.4
- nicer crafting output texture

### Changed

- improved performance
- wrong Minecraft version warning message
- [internal] complete rewrite in [beet](https://github.com/mcbeet/beet)

### Fixed

- recipe unlock notification when crafting the chunk loader
