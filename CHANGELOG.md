### Changed

- updated to Minecraft 1.21
- improved performance
- removed warning message if resourcepack is not installed

### Fixed

- no real native Chunk Loader recipe (used the knowledge book method)
  - recipe would not be displayed in the recipe book
  - "unlock all recipes" datapacks could break the datapack
  - recipe mods like JEI would not show the Chunk Loader recipe (closes #22)
